# Bridgecom Project : SIH Experience

## Introduction üöÄ
- This project is made for Smart India Hackathon 2024.
- The main aim of this project is to help deaf people to communicate with normal people using sign language.
- This project uses AI to convert sign language to text and vice versa.
- This project uses IoT to send the data to the server and get the response from the server.
- We use Raspberry Pi to send the data to the server. I also take help of cloud service to run my ML on cloud. So, we can just
send video input get my audio output.

## Tech Stack üõ†
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Raspberry Pi
- Cloud Service
- Network Communication
- FastAPI for server
- pyAudo for audio output
- pydub for audio conversion
- Engineering Mathematics

## Challenges ü§Ø
- The main challenge was to convert sign language to text and vice versa.
- The integration of IoT with AI was also a challenge.
- Integration of diffrent models to work efficiently is also big headache for us.

## Future Scope üöÄ
- We can use this project in real life to help deaf people.
- We can also use this project in military to communicate with each other without any sound.
- We can also use this project in education field to teach sign language to normal people.
- For Deaf and Dumb people, this project is a boon and help to be relevant in world of AR/VR.
- We can also use this project in medical field to communicate with patients who can't speak.

## Conclusion üéâ
- This project is a great experience for me.
- I learn a lot of things from this project.
- The special part is to work with team of 6 people and complete the project in 36 hours.
- All members of the team are very supportive and helpful and come from diffrent fields which is kind of advantage for us.
- I am very happy to be part of this project and I am very thankful to my team members and mentors who help me to complete this project.
